# Mastermind_Game
Mastermind Game using numbers and digits.

Mastermind Game where you can play as either the code breaker or code maker.
For the computer to break the player's code, I used a variation of Donald Knuth's, "Five-guess algorithm"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm
In this particular instance of the game, Mastermind, numbers 0-9999 are used instead of six colours,
creating 10000 (10^4) possible answers, instead of 1296 (6^4).

Created using Visual Studios Express 2013 for Desktop
